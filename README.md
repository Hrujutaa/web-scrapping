Web Scraping and Data Cleaning Project

This repository contains implementations of web scraping techniques and data cleaning processes used to collect, preprocess, and prepare raw data for analysis. The project demonstrates practical knowledge of extracting structured information from websites and transforming unstructured data into a clean, usable format.



Overview

The project focuses on two main stages:

1. Web Scraping – Extracting data from websites
2. Data Cleaning – Preprocessing and preparing data for analysis

The workflow includes:

* Sending HTTP requests
* Parsing HTML content
* Extracting structured data
* Storing data in CSV or structured formats
* Handling missing and inconsistent values
* Preparing datasets for further analysis or visualization



Web Scraping

Objective:
To extract relevant information from websites and convert it into structured datasets.

Tools and Libraries Used:

* Python
* requests
* BeautifulSoup
* pandas
* lxml (if applicable)

Key Concepts Implemented:

* Sending HTTP requests to web servers
* Inspecting HTML structure
* Extracting elements using tags, classes, and IDs
* Handling pagination
* Extracting tables and structured content
* Storing data in CSV or DataFrame format

Example Use Cases:

* Scraping product details (name, price, rating)
* Extracting news headlines
* Collecting tabular data
* Gathering structured information for analysis

Challenges Addressed:

* Handling missing HTML elements
* Managing inconsistent formatting
* Avoiding duplicate records
* Error handling during requests



Data Cleaning

Objective:
To preprocess raw scraped data and make it suitable for analysis.

Tools and Libraries Used:

* pandas
* NumPy

Data Cleaning Techniques Applied:

* Handling missing values (NaN removal or imputation)
* Removing duplicate entries
* Data type conversion
* String formatting and trimming
* Removing unwanted characters or symbols
* Standardizing column names
* Filtering irrelevant records
* Outlier detection (basic level)

Steps Followed:

1. Load dataset into pandas DataFrame
2. Explore dataset structure
3. Identify missing or inconsistent values
4. Apply transformations
5. Validate cleaned dataset
6. Export cleaned data



Workflow

1. Identify target website
2. Inspect HTML structure
3. Extract required fields
4. Store raw data
5. Perform cleaning and preprocessing
6. Save cleaned dataset for analysis



Skills Demonstrated

* Web data extraction
* HTML parsing
* Data preprocessing
* Handling real-world messy data
* Structured data transformation
* Problem-solving in data collection pipelines



Learning Outcomes

* Gained practical experience in web scraping techniques
* Understood how to handle real-world unstructured data
* Learned to clean and preprocess datasets efficiently
* Improved data manipulation skills using pandas
* Built foundation for data analysis and machine learning workflows
